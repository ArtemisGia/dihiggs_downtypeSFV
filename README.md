#### Resonant DiHiggs searches DownType SFV.

This repository contains the necessary files to produce the collider bounds from resonant di-Higgs production for a 2HDM defined following the SFV prescription (arXiv: 1811.00017). The experimental results are taken from:
- 2112.11876
- 2202.07288
- 2209.10910

Here I have used the output of a MadGraph5 simulation to convert the experimental bounds into the parameter space of this specific model.
